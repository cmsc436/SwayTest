        We are currently experiencing technical difficulties due to circumstances of potentially
        apocalyptic significance beyond our control. However, thanks to Emergency Testing Protocols,
        testing can continue. These pre-recorded messages will provide instructional and
        motivational support, so that science can still be done, even in the event of environmental,
        social, economic, or structural collapse. . . For the first exam please stand with your legs spread.
        . . . stand still. . . The portal will open and emergency testing will begin in three. Two. One.
